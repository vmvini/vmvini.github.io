                        Now Im working with <span class="button is-link is-rounded">GoWithFlow</span> and I'm happy there, <italic>but... it is difficult for me to just ignore an opportunity for companies like MongoDB</italic>
                        <br>
                        <br> Working for those companies I mentioned above, I learnt how to maintain and give extra life to dead projects!

                        <br>
                        <br> Also, I really enjoy developing <span class="button is-primary is-rounded">tools and libraries</span>. I always learn something new from my personal projects, and the feeling of developing something useful for other developers is insanely great.

                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <br>I was hired by RuppellsGriffon to work as a <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">junior fullstack web developer</span>, but more focused in the frontend development with <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">angular js</span>. I was in the final steps of my graduation course (System Analysis and Development), when I received an email with the job announcement.

                        <br><br>Their business model is all about giving their clients business insights from geospatial data. Their common projects involves gathering geospacial data, analyzing it, and expose it through applications.

                        <br><br>There I learnt how to build bigger frontend applications, keep tracking production environment through logs,  study a variety of web technologies (<span class="button is-warning is-rounded">Mapbox gl js</span>, <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">Google APIs</span>, <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">GeoJSON</span>, <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">MongoDB</span>)

                        <br><br>The project I was most excited to work on was one of their map applications on top of "Mapbox gl".  Although the frontend app was cool, I was mostly interested in the <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">background tools</span> I had to create to process raw geospatial data from different sources, so I had to organize that variety of data, extract points, geometries, convert them to GeoJSON. Also I had to build <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">crawlers</span> to gather data from different sites, including the site of the government of Australia. All of this, I did utilizing the javascript language, either on the browser, either on the server.

                    Integritas (United States) (2018) - Full Remote
                  </p>
                 <p style="text-align: left;"> Two years after working on Ruppells projects, I decided to move on and face a new adventure , which was Integritas. From their site: (www.integritas.net) "Integritas is an established, international software product development company, responsible for creating web, mobile, enterprise and big data solutions since 2004."

                    <br><br>At Integritas, my role was <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">frontend developer</span>, and I did work on 2 big projects. One of the projects I worked from scratch, let's call it project (H).
                        
                    <br><br>The project (H) consists of 3 projects, a <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">legacy website</span>, a new <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">hybrid mobile app</span> built with <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">Angular 2+</span>, a <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">node js server</span> built upon the <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">hapi framework</span>, and a <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">postgres database</span>.  I worked more on the mobile angular app, but offered support for the other 2 projects as well. 
                        
                    <br><br>The other project I mentioned to have worked on, let's call it as the project (S). I was allocated to work on this project after the project (H) MVP was done and successfully delivered. The team that worked on the project (S) was huge, at least 7 developers, and the project was almost a legacy one with lots of <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">technical debt</span>. (I think the guys from upstairs thought I could help to revive the almost dead project, and they were right). 
                        
                    <br><br>The project (ASS) (:D) was a huge management system with a lot of complex charts, tables, user interfaces, and its frontend was built using <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">Angular 2+.</span>
                        
                    <br><br>Due to the big team containing a variety of people from different cultures/countries, I learnt to communicate better with other devs and managers. Also, I had to practice the art of the code refactoring as our code base was pretty much fucked up.

                 <p style="text-align: left;">
                    I was living in Brazil at the time Aubay contacted me. They proposed me a relocation to Portugal, to work as a <span class="button is-rounded">developer consultant</span>.

                    <br><br>It was an incredible experience to move to a different country, and work on different clients and projects. Through Aubay clients, I've met the companies EdirectInsure, and GoWithFlow.

                    <br><br>Through a lot of work made in this period, I learnt how to handle <span class="button is-rounded">bad designed microservices</span>, <span class="button is-rounded">spaghetti architecture</span>. So, now I'm vaccinated against the temptation to create <span class="button is-rounded">direct http relationships</span> between what were supposed to be microservices.

                  </p>
                 <p style="text-align: left;">
                    After some time as developer consultant allocated at GoWithFlow, they called me to work directly with them. I was hired as a <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">senior software engineer</span> to maintain, improve and scale a subset of their systems, specifically the frontend solutions, and guide junior and middle developers.

<br><br>GoWithFlow, as described in their site (www.gowithflow.io) : "Formed officially as Flow in late 2019, when Portuguese energy giant Galp
acquired a majority stake, the company today manages thousands of vehicles,
EV charging stations and consumer end users across multiple software and
services implementations in corporations and communities around the world."

<br><br>At GoWithFlow, I learnt how to really work following a well designed development process, we follow <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">SCRUM</span> properly, we do <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">CI/CD</span> through gitlab, <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">unit and integration testing</span> as it is needed.

<br><br>The most exciting solution I have worked on was to bring our big frontend into a <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">microfrontend architecture</span>. A lot of refactoring was done, a lot of coupling was removed, so that subsets of the system could be separated and placed per domain, and yet reuse same shared services. <span class="button is-warning is-rounded">Angular's dependency injection</span> system was the hero to achieve this, as different microservices needed different implementations of the same interface.
